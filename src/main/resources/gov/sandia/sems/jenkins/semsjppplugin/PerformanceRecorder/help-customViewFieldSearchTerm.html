  Enter the search term for Watchr datasets here.  The search respects
  <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">Java-style regex.</a>
  In addition, you can either search on the name of datasets alone ("Search by name") or search
  on the entire path of a dataset ("Search by full path"), which will return more results.
  When you're ready to search, click on the "Search" button, and this page will re-load with search
  results.
