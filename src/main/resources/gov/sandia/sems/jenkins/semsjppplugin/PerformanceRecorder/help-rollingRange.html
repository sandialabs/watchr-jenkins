  Watchr uses the number specified here to determine the number of data points to
  use for "rolling" lines.  For each graph, a rolling average and/or rolling standard deviation
  line can be displayed.  This number determines how many of the most recent data points are used
  to calculate the average and standard deviation values.  For instance, using the number "30"
  will cause each point on a graph's average line to represent the average of the most recent 30
  data points.  If there are too few data points, the average and standard deviation will be based
  on all available data points.  Older data points will be ignored by the rolling line calculation.
