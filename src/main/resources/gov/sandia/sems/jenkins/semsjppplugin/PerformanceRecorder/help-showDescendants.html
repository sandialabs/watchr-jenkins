<div>
  If there is no data at a given level of your hierarchical report data set, checking this
  checkbox will display a level's children instead.  If those children also have no data, it will
  display the children's children instead, and so on recursively until data can be found.  If this
  checkbox is unchecked, then a graph with no data will simply display as empty.
