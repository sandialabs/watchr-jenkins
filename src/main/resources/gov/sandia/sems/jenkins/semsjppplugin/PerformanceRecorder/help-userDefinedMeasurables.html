<div>
  You are allowed to define which XML attributes from your performance report files should be graphed.
  Ideally, as you collect performance report data over time, the same attributes should re-occur in
  your series of reports.  Each attribute should record a new value for every new report that represents
  a point in time.  Therefore, these attributes are ideal candidates for data that can be plotted along 
  a graph.  The XML attributes for this field are what are called "measurables."  You can define as many
  measurables as you want (use spaces to separate multiple values).
