    Check this box if you would like Watchr to export all of its generated graphs as standalone HTML files in a time-stamped 
    directory in your Jenkins job workspace.  Parent-child relationships (represented by on-screen page links) will be removed 
    as a result of the export.  Also, the number of graphs within each HTML file is controlled by the "exportMode" Watchr config 
    file field.  You may use "perPlot" to export one HTML file per graph, or "perCategory" to export one HTML file per plot
    category.
